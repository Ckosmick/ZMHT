ZMHT v0.5.1 -- 2/9/2020
=============
-	Initial Release

# KNOWN ISSUES
	- SM controls: 			Usable, not perfect. When firing upward with L + R, samus will aim at an angle for a moment. Charge beam stops working with power bombs selected.
	- Modified SM item grabbing: 	Mostly works, but music does not play in room where you reobtain suit. I haven't figured it out yet.
	- Charge beam concentration: 	Samus' palette doesn't animate when her beam is charged, it just stays glowing.
