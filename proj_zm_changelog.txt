- Demo A in Kraid needed samus' Y position updated as it was out of bounds.
- Chozodia 1F was not possible to perfect-stealth due to projectiles hitting the ceiling above the pirate. The breakable wall has been shifted down one tile, and the pirate moved forward one tile.

===============
raygun: Fixed small issue with GBA controls.

Project ZM v0.6.3 -- 04/06/2020
===============

World design changes:
- You start at your ship

Project ZM v0.6.2 -- 03/29/2020

◘ Further fixes for SM controls patch
◘ World design change: Chozodia 22 correctly scrolls both vertically and horizontally
◘ Added back the solid wall effect in Brinstar 2 before using long beam statue
◘ Fixed bad backgrounds in the map station download screens due to tiles having transparency
◘ Balance changes: Plasma beam is 50% weaker in all forms
◘ Removed cutscene skip shortcut as it causes issues with sounds that cannot be fixed
◘ Message boxes close faster, about as soon as the expansion tank sound plays

Project ZM v0.6.1 -- 03/21/2020
===============
◘ Emergency fix for GBA controls in main patch
◘ World design change: Pirates in Chozodia E moved closer to middle of room

Project ZM v0.6 -- 03/20/2020
===============
◘ Gameplay changes:
	- SM Controls was rewritten and is now a togglable ingame option, in place of sound settings. (GBA Controls default) Worry not, the audio is now stereo by default.
	- Shinespark steering was rewritten to allow for vertical steering.
	- SM Style item grabbing was simplified.
	- A complete overhaul of ZM's physics by Captain Glitch! Samus' momentum is preserved, midair morphing doesn't stop you, and you can even build up a speedboost on multiple platforms. Mockball is a thing. Get ready TASers!
	- Super Metroid style projectiles: Running and shooting makes the projectile as fast as it is set + your move speed, but when standing still it doesnt care about your move speed.
	- Gravity Suit requires Varia to be resistant to heat, weak acid and lava. This ensures that Varia is now an item more worth grabbing.
	- Elevator and boss intro cutscenes can be skipped by pressing B.
◘ Visual changes:
	- New compact HUD and map graphics.
	- The mothership has its own unique breakable tiles graphics.
	- Varia suit determines the bigger suit graphics, not Gravity Suit.
	- In light of the above change, gravity suit has had a very slight adjustment to its palette to look okay in low power form.
◘ Fixed errors:
	- Unable to toggle unknown items
	- Grabbing unknown items played the wrong message and sound
	- Gravity suit not visible
	- Tiling error in Brinstar 14
	- Tiling error in Brinstar C
	- Minimap map station tiling error in tourian
	- Player was able to springball off of corners of tiles without high jump
	- Poor enemy placement in Norfair A, Chozodia 1D and Chozodia 5A
◘ World design changes:
	- Plasma beam is locked behind a super missile hatch, which means a requirement of at least one boss to be defeated before it can be accessed
	- The path below the wave beam chozo in Brinstar 15 now too contains beetles to skip the statue for a faster early varia
	- Added a zeb to Brinstar 15
	- Rooms containing zebs now have a hardmode variant with the unused blue zebs
	- Tourian has a map station.
	- Brinstar A was given a left steep slope on Kraid's part of the gate, no longer requiring a jump
	- The floor in Brinstar 10 was flattened, no longer requiring a jump
	- Norfair 20 has more blocks replaced with speedbooster blocks which should make sparking through it easier.
◘ Balance:
	- Redid rinka drops to hopefully be more fair. Below is technical information about changes made.
+=======================================+
|	0x400 Total drop chance budget		|
+=======================================+
|No drop: 		|	25C or 16C 	--> 100	|
|Small energy: 	|	A or 0 		--> A	|
|Large energy: 	|	32			--> 32	|
|Missile: 		|	15E or 258 	--> 2BA	|
|Super Missile: |	A			--> A	|
|Power Bomb: 	|	0			--> 0	|
+=======================================+


Project ZM v0.5.1 -- 02/10/2020
◘ Made the secret path to power grip more obvious
◘ Made the super missile block near varia suit room into a missile block, and more obvious so people don't get stuck/lost as much
◘ Weakened Mecha ridley's missiles to make 4% more viable
◘ Fixed a bunch of tiling errors in the room before varia suit
